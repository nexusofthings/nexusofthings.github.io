ootstrapping!
 
Those of you who watched Shark Tank India might have heard about this word. While in business it means thriving in business with minimum external funding, in Statistics it opened up a door wide open for making inferences about sample statistics. The method was developed by [Prof. Bradley Efron](https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/bradley-efron). An article in ([Significance magazine](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2010.00463.x)) explains in brief about the technique and its uses. There are [blog posts](https://data-flair.training/blogs/bootstrapping-in-r/) (among many others) which help understanding the basic concepts and uses of bootstrapping. 
 
Hope some of you find it interesting.
