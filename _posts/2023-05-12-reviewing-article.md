After building a research profile in established sites like OrdID, Google-Scholar or ResearchGate, Scopus, Pubmed etc. (among many others). 
However, typically an editor from the journal takes note of your work and invites you to review a manuscript or possiblity of you reviewing for them regularly.

Also, there are some journals which call for applications (especially from early career research fellows) to join the team as editors (AJP - application?)

Long term association with a journal (performing well in given tasks, giving helpful reviews on time regularly) can earn you a position to be a member of the editorial board.
