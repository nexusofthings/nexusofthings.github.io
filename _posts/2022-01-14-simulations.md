Simulations

Statistics exists because there is variation! Where there is variation there lies a lot of possibilites!
No method is perfect - in the sense - it won't give perfect result. 

Simulation in general refers to an imitation of a real scenario. 


In statistics, simulations are used for multitude of purposes. For example, when one develops(proposes) a new statistical method to do something, it may be needed to prove its mathematical properties, to test its performace under different conditions or to compare it to an (similar) exisiting method etc. 
It can also be used to test the temparament of a method - in other words, testing when they "fail".

For all these purpose, one cannot wait to come across such "real" datasets so as to "apply" them and test. Instead, they're tested using a synthetic, artificially generated datasets.

It is a lot easier to achieve all that when you have independece to create a set of data with "known" properties.

Factors to consider:
Simulation design
Assessing performance



There are several specialised R packages that can ....

I have tried a few of them and noting down few observations here.
