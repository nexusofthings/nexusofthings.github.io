There is no one universal tool which can be used in bioinformatics as it is a broad range of descipline and a lot depends on the question being asked and the context.
However, it is important to make sure that the the analysis is replicable/reproducible.

### Tracking issues:

It is important to choose software that has a good source of directly accessible documentation and being maintained periodically. (most of them will be hosted in open platform like GitHub where issues can
be tracked)


### Repeating the tasks:

Most of the times the same set of analysis needs to be repeated across samples or cohort of samples. Using the linux's in-built capability of running them in parallel or for-looping
will come handy in such situations. 



Using code repositories such as GitHub (link for the post related to gitub) for maintaining all the codes and related documents would be a great idea in such analyses. It is even more useful when working in 
collaboration with other researchers where shared work enhances productivity. 

Github 
Github is a popular platform available both on and offline which can host and offers tools to integarate codes, documentation and other related project contents. 
It is partly free for research and educational use but also offers paid plans with enhanced features.

What it does and how it does?
Public and private repositories
Visit GitHub.com for more with detailed tutorials.

Why use it?
Attracts visibility

How others can contribute?
Pull requests, opening new issues
There are some excellent examples of successful collaborative projects such as Biopython, Galaxy,  SAMtools, rOpenSci etc. among many others. 

Alternate options for GitHub are -  SourceForge, Bitbucket, GitLab.
