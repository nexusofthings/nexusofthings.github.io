Welcome to the NEXUS of things!

I'm a Biostatistician by profession with nearly 10 years of experience in the field. Along my career I have had opportunity to use different software products like MS-Excel, SPSS, Stata, SAS and of course R & Python to analyse various datasets. This place is my personal-public repository to document "what I learnt, how I learnt". 

The focus of this site is on the content rather than on the aesthetics at the moment. I know very minimum about websites and this page has been set up this page using [MinimalMistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. 

***DISCLAIMER***: I have been benefitted a lot from the open source materials from the websites lik [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Software-Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and many more. Some of the content here may just be the adaptation of material found on any of such sites.
