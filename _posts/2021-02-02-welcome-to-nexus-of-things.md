Welcome to the NEXUS of things!

I'm a Biostatistician by profession with nearly 10 years of experience in the field. In my career so far, I have had opportunities to use different software products like MS-Excel, SPSS, Stata, SAS and of course R & Python to analyse various datasets. I learnt things what I know today both from traditional (books, classrooms, library etc.) and modern (self learning via online, online courses, open source materials) ways of learning. I always wanted a space to put some of these for my own future reference as well as for the benefit of others. A huge thanks to [GitHub](https://github.com/) -  well, this place is now my personal-public repository to document "what I learnt, how I learnt". 

The focus of this site is on the content rather than on the aesthetics at the moment. My knowledge is very minimal in developing and maintaining websites and this page has been set up this page using [MinimalMistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. 

***DISCLAIMER***: I have been benefitted a lot from the open source materials from the websites like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Software-Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and many more. Some of the content here may just be the adaptation of material found on any of such sites.
